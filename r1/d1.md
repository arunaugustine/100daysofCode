Today Nov 1 2019 is my first day of #100daysOfCode

I am typing this from Cochin International Airport, waiting for my flight to Singapore
For the Hubspot Grow conference. I am hoping to spend at least one hour everyday still,
working on our Elixir prototype of the event sourcing system for CornerCart.

Wish me luck!
